🔹 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, typically on a server.

🧩 Think of it like this:
In a browser, JavaScript can handle buttons, forms, or animations.
In Node.js, JavaScript can handle files, databases, servers, and APIs.

🔹 How Node.js Works

Node.js uses V8 Engine (same as Google Chrome) to run JavaScript.

It is asynchronous and event-driven, meaning it handles multiple tasks at once efficiently.

It’s single-threaded, but can manage thousands of requests simultaneously through non-blocking I/O.

⚙️ Real-life analogy:
A waiter in a restaurant (Node.js) takes multiple orders and serves them one by one without waiting for the kitchen to finish cooking one order before taking the next.

🔹 REPL Mode (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

This is the interactive shell for Node.js — like a playground for trying out JS code quickly.

🧩 To start:

node

Now type:

 let a = 10
 let b = 5
 a + b
15
You can see the result immediately!

🔹 Script Mode

Instead of writing commands one by one, you can create a .js file and run it.
