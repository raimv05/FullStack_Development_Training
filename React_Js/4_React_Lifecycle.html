<!-- ✅ React Functional Component Lifecycle :- 

🔵 1. Mounting (Component is Born)

This happens when the component is shown on the screen for the first time.

👉 Real-life Example:
When a person enters a room for the first time — they settle, introduce themselves, turn on lights, etc.

👉 In React:
When your component loads for the first time, you can:

Fetch data from API

Start a timer

Initialize state

👉 In functional components we use:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component Mounted");
}, []);

The empty array [] means this effect runs only once when the component mounts.

🟡 2. Updating (Component Changes/Updates)

This happens whenever state or props change.

👉 Real-life Example:
A person inside a room moves the chair, reads a book, talks to someone — the environment updates.

👉 In React:
Your component updates when:

A button changes a value

API updates the screen

User types into a textbox

👉 We use:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component Updated");
});

This runs after every re-render.

Or to run only when a specific state changes:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("count state updated");
}, [count]);
This runs only when 'count' changes.

🔴 3. Unmounting (Component is Removed)

This happens when the component disappears from screen.

👉 Real-life Example:
When a person leaves the room — they turn off lights, close doors, clean up unwanted items.

👉 In React:
You should clean things up like:

Removing event listeners

Clearing timers

Closing WebSocket connections

👉 We use cleanup function:

useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log("Component Unmounted");
  };
}, []);
This runs when the component is about to unmount. -->
