<!-- ⭐ What is React? 

React is:

✔ A JavaScript library
✔ Used to build user interfaces (UI)
✔ Created by Facebook
✔ Helps build websites that are fast, dynamic, and interactive


⭐ How Does React Work?

React uses a concept called Virtual DOM.

🧠 Real-Life Example:

Let’s say you want to change 1 photo in a scrapbook.

Without React →
You rewrite the entire scrapbook (slow)

With React (Virtual DOM) →
You only replace that one photo (fast)

✔ React looks at:

The real DOM

The virtual DOM

Finds what changed

Updates ONLY that part in the real browser

👉 Result = Fast UI without refreshing the whole page -->
