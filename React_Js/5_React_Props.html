✅ 1. What are Props in React?

Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are read-only and help make components reusable by allowing them to accept different inputs.

🧠 Technical Definition

Props are used to:

Pass data

Pass functions

Customize child components

They are read-only (child cannot modify them).

✅ 2. Props Destructuring

Destructuring is a JavaScript feature that allows you to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a more concise way.

Without destructuring:
props.name
props.age
props.city

With destructuring:
const { name, age, city } = props;

📌 Why use it?

✔ Cleaner code
✔ Easier to read
✔ Less typing

✅ 3. Props.children in React

props.children allows you to pass nested elements from parent to child.

📌 Simple Meaning:

"Whatever you put between opening and closing tags."

<Note >
  <p>This is inside the Note component.</p>
</Note>
Everything inside becomes props.children.
