<!-- ✅ 1. What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React that allows developers to write UI structure using an HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript.

React doesn’t understand JSX directly — it works after being transpiled by Babel into pure JavaScript (React.createElement() calls).

⭐ Why JSX is used 

Makes UI structure easier to read and maintain

Allows HTML + JavaScript logic together (declarative UI)

Prevents mistakes through compile-time checks

Helps React optimize the virtual DOM tree

🎯 Example JSX → JavaScript conversion

JSX:

<h1>Hello</h1>

After Babel:

React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");

✅ 2. What is a React Component?

A React component is a reusable, independent piece of UI.
It is like a small function that receives inputs (props) and returns a UI description (JSX).

A React component is a reusable, independent piece of UI.
It is like a small function that receives inputs (props) and returns a UI description (JSX).

React components can be:

Functional components (modern, recommended)

Class components (older, legacy)

⭐ Why Components Matter

Reusability → build once, use everywhere

Maintainability → small pieces are easy to test

Fast rendering → React can update only affected components

Scalability → supports large applications

🎯 Example

function Button(props) {
  return <button>{props.label}</button>;
}

✅ 3. What is HMR (Hot Module Replacement)?


HMR is a feature provided by modern bundlers (like Vite, Webpack, Parcel) that allows React applications to update modules in the browser without a full page reload.

It replaces only the changed parts of your code.

⭐ Benefits 

Faster development (no full reload)

Preserves app state (form inputs don’t reset)

Reduces development time in large apps

Improves feedback loop for frontend engineers

🎯 Example

If you change text in a component:

<h1>Hello World</h1>

to

<h1>Hello React</h1>

HMR updates only that piece in the browser instantly, without reloading.

✅ 4. Why React Uses Functions to Build UI?

React uses functional components because they are simpler, faster, and align perfectly with React’s declarative and component-based architecture.

⭐ Key Industry Reasons
1. Simpler & More Predictable

Functions are stateless by default → easier to understand and test.

2. Hooks Work Only in Functions

Modern React features (useState, useEffect, useContext) work only in functional components.

3. More Performant

Functional components:

Use less memory

Have fewer lifecycle overheads

Are optimized by React’s internal engine

4. Align With Modern JavaScript

Functions are the core building blocks in modern JS development.

5. Declarative UI Matches Functional Programming

React favors “UI = f(state)”
→ UI is seen as a pure function of the state.

🎯 Example

function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome User</h1>;
} -->
npm create vite@latest my-react-app
